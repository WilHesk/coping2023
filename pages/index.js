We're so grateful to the incredibly tallented artists who have donated their time and tallents to create a beautiful set of 16 one off skatboards available now on our auction. Withington Walls & Art Battle Manchester have currated a list of incredible artists to create these awesome, one of a kind decks for our art auction. 50% of the money raised for each board goes to the artist and 50% goes to a mental health charity chosen by the artist whose board sells for the most!"
